# pySoar95SML
***This is an extraction from Soar 9.5 to study the Python interface."""

The only other thing you should need is a .so file for a elf/linux
system or a .dll on windows. I'm not sure what a Mac might need... 

This project was verified to run on linux using the Python interface 
distributed with Soar 9.5.x and the included _Python_sml_ClientInterface.so
